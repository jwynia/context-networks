# V2 Feedback Guide: Help Shape the Universal Context Engine

The Universal Context Engine (V2) represents a fundamental evolution from manual markdown-based context networks to intelligent, automated context management. Your real-world experience with context networks is invaluable for making V2 truly useful.

## What We're Looking For

### 📈 Success Stories
Understanding what worked helps us preserve and automate the best patterns:

- **Productivity Gains**: How did context networks change your development workflow?
- **Agent Performance**: Where did AI assistants become noticeably more effective?
- **Knowledge Preservation**: What information was successfully maintained over time?
- **Team Collaboration**: How did context networks improve team coordination?
- **Pattern Discovery**: What organizational patterns emerged naturally?

### 😤 Pain Points
Understanding what broke down guides our automation priorities:

- **Maintenance Burden**: How much time did upkeep consume? Where did you cut corners?
- **Information Drift**: What got stale, duplicated, or inconsistent over time?
- **Agent Confusion**: Where did AI assistants struggle with context networks?
- **Scalability Issues**: At what project size or complexity did problems emerge?
- **Abandonment Triggers**: What made you scale back or abandon your context network?

### 🔄 Common Problems
Help us understand recurring issues:

- **Duplicate Files**: Did agents create multiple `current_tasks.md`, `todo.md`, `notes.md`?
- **Stale Content**: What information became outdated but wasn't refreshed?
- **Navigation Issues**: Where did you or agents get lost in the network?
- **Maintenance Gaps**: What fell through the cracks during busy periods?
- **Integration Friction**: What didn't play well with your existing tools?

## V2-Specific Feedback

### 🚀 Feature Reactions
Which proposed V2 capabilities excite or concern you?

**Automated Deduplication**
- Would preventing duplicate task files actually help your workflow?
- What about false positives - legitimate files that seem similar but aren't?

**Multi-Perspective Access**
- How would you use different "lenses" (debugging, feature development, onboarding)?
- What task-specific views would be most valuable?

**Historical Context Preservation**
- How important is preserving deleted branches and failed experiments?
- What historical information do you wish you had kept?

**Decision Governance System**
- How do you feel about agents asking for approval on architectural decisions?
- What categories of decisions should require human input vs. be automated?

### 🏗️ Architecture Questions
Technical aspects we're validating:

**Database Approach**
- Graph database for relationships + analytics database for queries - does this make sense?
- What concerns do you have about binary storage vs. plain text?

**Memory Model**
- Working memory → semantic storage → episodic archive - is this intuitive?
- How should consolidation work? Daily? Weekly? On-demand?

**Agent Integration**
- Should V2 intercept all file operations or only specific ones?
- How intrusive should the "continuity cortex" be?

## Domain-Specific Experiences

### Software Development
- What code organization patterns did context networks help or hurt?
- How did they affect refactoring, debugging, or onboarding?
- Did they integrate well with IDEs, git workflows, CI/CD?

### Content Creation
- For documentation, blog posts, or books - what worked?
- How did context networks handle research, drafts, and revisions?
- What about collaboration with editors or reviewers?

### Contract Work
- Did you try context networks for client projects?
- How did they handle project boundaries and confidentiality?
- What about knowledge transfer and handoff?

### Other Domains
- Business processes, project management, research, education?
- What unexpected use cases emerged?
- Where did the framework surprise you (positively or negatively)?

## Specific Scenarios We're Testing

### The Amnesia Loop
Have you experienced agents creating multiple files for the same purpose?
- `current_tasks.md`, `todo.md`, `next_steps.md`, `action_items.md`
- `notes.md`, `thoughts.md`, `ideas.md`, `random.md`
- `architecture.md`, `design.md`, `structure.md`

How often did this happen? What patterns did you notice?

### Context Abandonment
Tell us about networks you started but didn't maintain:
- What was the breaking point?
- Was it time, complexity, or usefulness?
- What would have made the difference?

### Agent Confusion
Where did AI assistants misunderstand or misuse context networks?
- Following links incorrectly
- Missing relevant information
- Creating inappropriate content
- Ignoring established patterns

## How to Share Your Experience

### Quick Feedback
**[5-Minute Survey](https://github.com/jwynia/context-networks/issues/new?template=v2-feedback.md)** - Quick structured questions

### Detailed Case Studies
**[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jwynia/context-networks/discussions)** - In-depth project stories

### Specific Issues
**[Bug Reports](https://github.com/jwynia/context-networks/issues)** - Concrete problems you encountered

### Private Feedback
**Email**: For sensitive information, client projects, or detailed case studies

## What We'll Do With Your Feedback

Your input directly influences:

1. **Feature Prioritization**: Which capabilities to build first
2. **Default Configurations**: Smart starting points for different project types  
3. **Migration Strategies**: How to transition from V1 to V2
4. **Documentation**: Examples and guides based on real usage
5. **Error Prevention**: Avoiding pitfalls you've already discovered

## Example Feedback That Helps

### Great Feedback Examples:

> "After 3 months, my context network became a dumping ground. Agents would add information but never update existing entries. The 'current_tasks.md' had tasks from 6 weeks ago mixed with yesterday's items. I spent more time cleaning it up than it saved me."

> "The discovery section worked brilliantly for our team. New developers could trace how we arrived at architectural decisions. But the agents kept creating new discovery files instead of updating existing ones, so we ended up with 12 'authentication-research.md' files."

> "Context networks transformed our client work. Having all project context in one place meant smoother handoffs and better continuity. However, maintaining privacy boundaries between projects became a manual nightmare."

### Less Helpful Feedback:

> "It didn't work for me."
> "Too complicated."  
> "AI is bad at this."

Help us understand the *why* behind your experience!
