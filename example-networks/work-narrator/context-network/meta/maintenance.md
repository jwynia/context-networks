# Context Network Maintenance Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for maintaining the Job Chronicler Context Network to ensure it remains organized, up-to-date, and valuable over time.

## Regular Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Activity | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Weekly | Inbox Processing | Process any documents in the inbox folder, integrate information, and archive originals. |
| Monthly | Structure Review | Review the organization structure to ensure it remains effective and intuitive. |
| Quarterly | Content Audit | Review existing nodes for accuracy, completeness, and relevance. |
| Annually | Comprehensive Evaluation | Evaluate the entire context network for effectiveness and plan improvements. |

## Maintenance Procedures

### Weekly: Inbox Processing

1. Check the `inbox/` folder for new documents
2. For each document:
   - Follow the [Document Integration Process](../processes/document_integration.md)
   - Archive the document following the [Archiving Process](../processes/archiving.md)
3. Update the [Update Log](./update_log.md) with integration events

### Monthly: Structure Review

1. Review the organization structure:
   - Are categories still relevant?
   - Is information easy to find?
   - Are there emerging categories that should be added?
2. Check for orphaned nodes (nodes without proper links)
3. Verify that navigation paths remain clear and intuitive
4. Make structural adjustments as needed
5. Update the [Update Log](./update_log.md) with any structure changes

### Quarterly: Content Audit

1. Review a sample of nodes from each domain:
   - Is the information still accurate?
   - Are templates being followed consistently?
   - Are relationships properly documented?
2. Identify and fix common issues
3. Look for patterns that might indicate systemic problems
4. Update the [Update Log](./update_log.md) with significant content changes

### Annually: Comprehensive Evaluation

1. Review the entire context network:
   - Overall organization
   - Template effectiveness
   - Process efficiency
   - Information quality
2. Gather feedback on usability and value
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Develop and implement an improvement plan
5. Update documentation to reflect changes
6. Update the [Update Log](./update_log.md) with evaluation results and changes

## Quality Checks

During maintenance, verify:

### Structure Quality
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical folder organization
- Clear navigation paths
- Appropriate categorization

### Content Quality
- Adherence to templates
- Completeness of information
- Accuracy and currency
- Proper relationship documentation

### Process Quality
- Effective document integration
- Proper archiving
- Consistent update logging
- Timely maintenance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Duplicate Information
- Identify instances of duplication
- Consolidate information into a single node
- Update all references to point to the consolidated node
- Document the consolidation in the update log

### Missing Relationships
- Identify nodes that should be related but aren't linked
- Add appropriate cross-references
- Verify bidirectional linking

### Template Drift
- Identify nodes that have deviated from standard templates
- Update nodes to conform to current templates
- If template changes are needed, update the template and document the change

### Orphaned Nodes
- Identify nodes without proper connections to the network
- Either integrate them properly or archive if no longer relevant
- Document the resolution in the update log

## Continuous Improvement

The maintenance process itself should evolve over time:

1. Document challenges encountered during maintenance
2. Identify patterns in maintenance issues
3. Adjust procedures to address recurring problems
4. Update this maintenance document to reflect improved processes

## Maintenance Log

Record all maintenance activities in the [Update Log](./update_log.md) to maintain a history of changes and improvements to the context network.
