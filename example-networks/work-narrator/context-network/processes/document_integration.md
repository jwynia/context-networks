# Document Integration Process

This document outlines the process for integrating new documents from the inbox folder into the context network.

## Overview

The document integration process ensures that information from new documents is properly extracted, categorized, and linked within the context network structure. This maintains the organization and accessibility of job-related information.

## Process Steps

1. **Document Identification**
   - Monitor the `inbox/` folder for new documents
   - Identify the document type and content focus

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Review the document to identify key information
   - Determine which category/categories the information belongs to:
     - Work Products
     - Impact
     - Responsibilities
     - Relationships
     - Problem Solving

3. **Information Extraction**
   - Extract relevant information based on the appropriate template(s)
   - Identify relationships to existing information nodes

4. **Node Creation**
   - Create new information node(s) using the appropriate template from `foundation/templates.md`
   - Place the node in the correct domain folder
   - Ensure all required sections are completed

5. **Relationship Documentation**
   - Link the new node to related existing nodes
   - Update existing nodes to reference the new node where appropriate

6. **Document Archiving**
   - Once all information has been extracted and integrated, archive the original document
   - Follow the process outlined in `processes/archiving.md`

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Categories

If a document contains information relevant to multiple categories:
- Create separate nodes for each category
- Cross-reference these nodes in the "Related Information" sections
- Ensure no information is duplicated unnecessarily

### Updating Existing Nodes

When new information relates to existing nodes:
- Update the existing node with the new information
- Add a change history entry
- Update the "Last Updated" metadata

## Quality Checks

Before completing the integration process, verify:
- All relevant information has been extracted
- Nodes are properly categorized and placed
- Relationships are documented bidirectionally
- Templates are followed consistently
- No information gaps exist

## Maintenance

Periodically review the integration process to ensure it remains effective and efficient. Update this document as the process evolves.
