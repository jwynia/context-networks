# Recommended Practices for Context Networks

This document outlines key recommended practices for effectively creating, managing, and utilizing context networks, particularly for human users.

## Version Control Best Practices

Effective management of a context network, especially in collaborative or AI-assisted environments, relies heavily on disciplined version control:

*   **Commit Frequently:** Treat the context network like critical code. Commit changes very often, ideally after each significant update or refinement to a node or relationship. This creates a detailed history and minimizes potential data loss. Small, atomic commits make it easier to understand changes and revert if necessary.
*   **Branch Aggressively:** Don't hesitate to use branches for exploring new structures, drafting significant changes, or isolating work on specific sections of the network (e.g., planning a new feature). Short-lived branches are generally preferred.
*   **Merge Challenges:** Be aware that merging branches that modify the `context-network` directory structure or interconnected files can be complex, especially for automated agents. Merging often requires careful manual reconciliation to ensure the integrity and consistency of the network's relationships. The longer a branch lives diverge from the main line, the more difficult this reconciliation becomes. Consider strategies like rebasing frequently or breaking down large changes to minimize merge conflicts.
*   **Separate Repository (Optional but Recommended):** For complex projects or larger teams, consider managing the context network in its own dedicated Git repository, linked via the `.context-network.md` discovery file. This isolates its history and simplifies version control management compared to mixing it with project artifact commits.
