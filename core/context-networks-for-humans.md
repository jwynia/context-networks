# Context Networks: Human Implementation Guide

This guide addresses practical considerations for human teams implementing context networks in organizations, complementing the core framework with operational guidance.

## 1. Integration with Existing Systems

Context networks rarely exist in isolation. Here's how to integrate them with existing tools and processes:

### Existing Knowledge Management Systems

1. **Mapping Process**:
   - Inventory current knowledge repositories (wikis, documentation, shared drives)
   - Create correspondence tables between existing categories and context network domains
   - Identify integration points where cross-linking would be valuable
   - Document search/retrieval patterns that should be preserved

2. **Progressive Integration**:
   - Start with a high-value subset rather than complete migration
   - Create "bridge documents" that link between systems during transition
   - Implement parallel updates during the transition period
   - Establish "system of record" guidelines for overlapping content

3. **Technical Integration Options**:
   - API-based connections between systems where available
   - Automated cross-linking via consistent identifiers
   - Regular synchronization processes for changing content
   - Federated search across integrated systems

### Project Management Tools

1. **Connection Points**:
   - Link task management items to relevant context network nodes
   - Create automated updates to active context from project milestones
   - Design reference templates for including context network links in project artifacts
   - Establish workflow triggers for context network updates

2. **Meeting Integration**:
   - Include context network review in regular project meetings
   - Design agenda templates that reference relevant context
   - Create meeting note formats that facilitate context updates
   - Establish feedback loops between decisions and documentation

## 2. Onboarding Process

A structured onboarding process is essential for bringing new team members into an existing context network:

### Orientation Protocol

1. **First Day Process**:
   - Provide system overview using meta-documentation
